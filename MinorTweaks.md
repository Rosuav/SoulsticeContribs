Small ideas and random coolnesses.

When Eva talks to Sera about not being able to afford food, she says she has
83 cents on her. Can she say 86 cents, evoking a response of "Living large in
Lunea Bay, eh?"? (She also quotes her wealth in conversation with Bean Sprout,
at which point she says 89 cents. Synchronizing would be good here.)

I know it's just a stub, but the pause menu "Journal" page has an "it's" where
"its" would be correct.

Nothing on the Pause menu says how to unpause and return to the game. I had to
guess at keys (Esc doesn't, nor does P - Tab does).
