# Technomancy

Technomancy is a skill which Eva doesn't study, and quite frankly, doesn't
comprehend. When she explores the classroom where it's taught, she will be able
to meet Rosuav, who is either a senior student or a teacher (your choice); he
has the uncanny ability to make strange objects do weird and wonderful things,
by merely making complex gestures at them. (Should be easy enough to make a
crude animation that captures Eva's understanding of technomantic gestures.)

She can talk to Rosuav, who will tell her about his true love, Pike. She is a
thing of immeasurable beauty in his eyes, and the two of them work together
to do amazing things. She won't realize that Pike is actually one of the
devices he works with. The dialogue will be somewhat ambiguous to start with,
then get rather less ambiguous further on, but Eva won't figure it out (at
least, not during the conversation). There may be services that Rosuav can
perform for Eva (to move quests along), but she has to earn his respect first,
by performing some simple fetch quest, perhaps. ("I need the new <nonce> from
<location> and I can't leave here or <disaster> will happen!")

Rosuav dresses in blues and cyans, muted colours and muted emotions. He tends
to eschew overt passion in favour of dead-pan elocution, and has an extensive
vocabulary - and also deliberately misuses words or uses perfectly cromulent
fakes on occasions.
