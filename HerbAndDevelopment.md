Book entitled "Herb and Development".

All cities should be designed, not merely permitted to grow organically by the
native inhabitants. Development requires planning and careful consideration or
individual goals will overtake the more important community needs. Should some
services be made inaccessible, reinstating them could be difficult - involving
extensive (and expensive) reconstruction work. (Be that as it may, sometimes a
wrecker is needed. Done properly and kept to an absolute minimum, but still an
available option.) In order to ensure that citizens get access to such crucial
services as commerce, clean water, and Chrysalis, roads and paths must be made
around the time of first construction. Line them up on compass directions, and
build them slightly raised, and above all, build them well. With long term use
in mind, build the roads according to Macadam, whose pioneering enthusiasm was
the cornerstone (if you'll forgive the pun) of road construction for years; in
his wisdom, watching drudge labour produce roads that cracked after just seven
years, he demanded that his workers be paid appropriately. Pep talks and other
measures to share his enthusiasm led to more sturdily built roads than before.
Eight years on, his roads are still usable, proving his point completely. QED.
